      question: "What is AI cybersecurity, and how does it differ from traditional cybersecurity?",
      answer: "AI cybersecurity leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats automatically. Unlike traditional cybersecurity, which relies on predefined rules and human intervention, AI cybersecurity can adapt to new threats in real-time, learn from patterns, and make autonomous decisions to protect systems."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of threats can AI cybersecurity protect against?",
      answer: "AI cybersecurity can protect against a wide range of threats including malware, phishing attacks, DDoS attacks, insider threats, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It's particularly effective at identifying unusual patterns that might indicate new or evolving threats, and can respond to multiple threats simultaneously."
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI help in threat detection and prevention?",
      answer: "AI enhances threat detection by analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time, identifying patterns and anomalies that might indicate a security threat. It can predict potential vulnerabilities, automate incident response, and continuously learn from new threats to improve its detection capabilities over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Is AI cybersecurity effective against zero-day attacks?",
      answer: "Yes, AI cybersecurity can be effective against zero-day attacks because it doesn't solely rely on known threat signatures. By analyzing behavior patterns and identifying anomalies, AI can detect and respond to previously unknown threats, making it particularly valuable in protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of human cybersecurity professionals in AI cybersecurity?",
      answer: "Human cybersecurity professionals play a crucial role in AI cybersecurity by training AI systems, setting security policies, analyzing AI-generated insights, making strategic decisions, and handling complex scenarios that require human judgment. They work alongside AI systems to create a more robust security infrastructure."
